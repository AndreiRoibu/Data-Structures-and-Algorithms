# Given a binary array nums, return the maximum length of a contiguous
# subarray with an equal number of 0 and 1.


# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [0,1]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: [0, 1] is the longest contiguous subarray with an
# equal number of 0 and 1.
# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [0,1,0]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: [0, 1] (or [1, 0]) is a longest contiguous subarray
# with equal number of 0 and 1.
# Example 3:

# Input: nums = [0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0]
# Output: 6
# Explanation: [1,1,1,0,0,0] is the longest contiguous subarray
# with equal number of 0 and 1.

# Complexity Analysis:
# Time complexity: O(n) - We traverse the array once, performing O(1) operations
# for each element. Thus, the overall time complexity is linear with respect to
#  the size of the input array.
# Space complexity: O(n) - In the worst case, we may store all unique
# cumulative sums in the hashmap. Therefore, the space complexity is also linear
# with respect to the size of the input array.
