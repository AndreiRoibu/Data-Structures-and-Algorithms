# 392. Is Subsequence
# Easy
# Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

# A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original
# string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the
# relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence
# of "abcde" while "aec" is not).


# Example 1:

# Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
# Output: true
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
# Output: false


# Constraints:

# 0 <= s.length <= 100
# 0 <= t.length <= 104
# s and t consist only of lowercase English letters.


# Follow up: Suppose there are lots of incoming s, say s1, s2, ..., sk where
# k >= 10**9, and you want to check one by one to see if t has its subsequence.
# In this scenario, how would you change your code?

        i = j = 0
        while i < len(s) and j < len(t):
            if s[i] == t[j]:
                i += 1
            j += 1

        return i == len(s)


# Complexity Analysis
# Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of t. In the worst case, we
# might have to iterate through all characters of t.
# Space complexity: O(1), as we are using only a constant amount of extra space.
