# Data Structures and Algorithms
A repository allowing me to track my study of data structures and algorithms.

## Installation

To install, first make sure you have `just` and `uv` installed. If you don't, run:

```bash
brew install just uv
```

Then, clone the repository and simply run:

```bash
just install
```

Finally, remember to install the pre-commit hooks:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

## Contents

The files are not intended to be ran as packages. Rather, they are the codes I wrote on platforms such as leetcode.com, hackerrank.com, etc. to solve various problems. Each file is named after the problem it solves. Also, each file contains a docstring at the top explaining the problem it solves, and the time/space complexity of the solution.
